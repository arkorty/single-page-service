Watermill Institutional Trading, LLC: Overview and Bios

With a combined forty years of industry experience, Watermill Institutional Trading, LLC (“Watermill”) was founded by Benjamin Bram and Gregory Wachsteter in August 2010. From 2009 through August 2010, Ben and Greg headed a team being operated as a separate division within Williams Trading, while waiting for their Broker-Dealer FINRA approval. Ben began his career in 1984 as a block trader in the Trading and Arbitrage Division of Goldman Sachs. He was named a Managing Director in 1998 and managed different sectors and traders, including the consumer, energy and health care sectors until January 2006. Greg started on the buy side in 1997 at Sanford C. Bernstein and transitioned to the sell side in 2002 as a sales trader at Kevin Dann & Partners with a focus on energy. Watermill’s goal is to add value to our client relationships, which are mainly comprised of institutional portfolio managers, analysts, and traders.

At Watermill, we understand the investing public expects specific services and benefits from broker-dealers, such as access to management, financial models, value-added information flow, and exceptional execution. We’ve carved our niche in the industry by providing our clients with important information flow and best execution. Every individual that sits on our trading desk has a multi-tasking skill set which enables each trader to speak to portfolio managers, analysts, as well as traders. Each of our market professionals at Watermill specializes in at least one sector, which includes energy, industrials, consumer and health care. Each morning our clients receive from our sector specialists a comprehensive recap consisting of news, street research, and market-moving events in each covered sector. Watermill’s investment in premier real-time news and information content reduces costs and saves time for our clients as they prepare for their workday. We offer a deep knowledge base within specific sectors, and combine it with trading expertise in all market cycles, all of which distinguishes Watermill’s unique value-add.

Relevant and timely real-time information flow is our specialty. In our opinion, sentiment and positioning have become more important than ever. Watermill’s network of relationships has given us a powerful edge in preventing our clients from making costly mistakes. Knowing when stocks are “crowded” is something all investment professionals are concerned with. Timely information flow is another area where we add value. Our customized service and idea-generation help our clients profit handsomely. Using news wires, street research, and monitoring erratic stock movements, we extract what’s important for our clients, and alert them to market movements they may have overlooked. Trading has changed drastically over the past few years. By utilizing state of the art technology and algorithms, Watermill has successfully navigated industry transitions with confidence in the knowledge that we offer the best execution and liquidity solutions for our clients. We are currently employing multiple algorithm providers each with active as well as passive execution strategies.

We highly value the relationships we have with our clients, who in our view have become our partners in navigating the markets. At Watermill, we fully believe that our success is directly correlated with the success of our clients.
